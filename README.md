# TrashVax -- UPDATED
Android app (made in React Native) for checking www.prullenbakvaccin.nl. You can set notifications to be informed when vaccins are available in your area.

# Installation
To install the app, click on the .apk file above, then download from github onto your Android device (or click [this link to download](https://github.com/KJ-Waller/TrashVax/raw/main/TrashVax-65550f8c38614583857b8eace40f7ebe-signed.apk). Once downloaded, install the apk file.

# Usage
Open the app, fill in your postal code, and hit the search button.

After a couple of seconds, the local vaccine locations that would show normally on prullenbakvaccin should be listed.

Set a time interval for how often to check if vaccines are available for the selected postal code. Once vaccines are left over, you'll get a notification

App must remain running in the background to provide notifications

# Disclaimers
* I haven't had the opportunity to properly test the app for when a location actually becomes available, as I wouldn't know what the website would say in case there is a vaccine. I'm not a software developer, and I don't guarantee the app works perfectly.
* You still have to make sure to bring a valid ID and checklist as specified on the prullenbakvaccin.nl website.
* The app must keep running in the background for your to receive notifications. It will drain your battery a bit more quickly than usual, so I advise you shut it down over night and uninstall it after you have received a vaccine and no longer need the app.
