# TrashVax
Android app (made in React Native) for checking www.prullenbakvaccin.nl. You can set notifications to be informed when vaccins are available in your area.

# Installation
To install the app, click on the .apk file above, then download from github onto your Android device. Once downloaded, install the apk file.

# Usage
Open the app, fill in your postal code, and hit the search button.

After a couple of seconds, the local vaccine locations that would show normally on prullenbakvaccin should be listed.

Set a time interval for how often to check if vaccines are available for the selected postal code. Once vaccines are left over, you'll get a notification

App must remain running in the background to provide notifications

* Disclaimer: I haven't had the opportunity to test the app for when a location actually becomes available, as I wouldn't know what the website would say in case there is a vaccine. I don't guarantee the app works perfectly.
